# Tic Tac Toe-Frontend
This project is a tictactoe frontend game (using coins which are prettier than X &amp; O), and as a part of SE Factory Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp projects.

# About the Game
This game is made of 2 users(players), 1 board of 9 tiles. The game always start with the redCoin(player1, X) then the player turn goes to yellowCoin(player2, O). The game ends when one user complete a winning pattern: (https://www.exploratorium.edu/brain_explorer/tictactoe.html). When a user wins or no more tiles are empty the game stops and the scores changes along with the title, if only one of the users wins for sure
Then comes the Restart-Button which allows the users to restart the game when the game is assured to end in a draw, or when a user wins.
